| Option          | Best For                    | Pros                                       | Cons                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **kubeadm**     | Production/Custom setup     | Full control, production-ready             | Manual setup, complex            |
| **k3s**         | Lightweight HA              | Simple HA with embedded etcd, low resource | Limited features vs full K8s     |
| **RKE2**        | Secure and supported K3s    | Built-in HA, hardened                      | Slightly heavier than k3s        |
| **k0s**         | Zero-friction HA            | No dependencies, embedded etcd             | Less community support           |
| **Kubespray**   | Ansible-based multi-node HA | Automated, flexible                        | Learning curve, external tooling |
| **Openshift**   | Enterprise HA               | Built-in HA, fully featured                | Heavy, resource-intensive        |
| **GKE/EKS/AKS** | Managed HA                  | Auto HA, easy ops                          | Vendor lock-in, cost             |
| **kind/k3d**    | Local testing only          | Fast to test HA config                     | Not for real HA use              |
For **on-prem/self-managed**:

- Use **kubeadm** or **k3s** (with external etcd or embedded HA).
- For minimal resource: **k3s with HA** is ideal.
- For full control: **kubeadm with external etcd** is best.

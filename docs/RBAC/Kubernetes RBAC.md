Kubernetes RBAC(Role-Based Access Control) like you're explaining it to your junior.

### 🧠 **Imagine This Simple Setup**

You are the **admin** of an office building (Kubernetes cluster).  
There are:

- **People** (users or service accounts)
- **Rooms** (resources like pods, configmaps, etc.)
- **Keys** (permissions)

You decide:

- Who can **enter which room**
- What they can **do inside**

### 🗝️ **RBAC = Giving Right Keys to Right People**

RBAC uses 4 main objects:

|Object|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Role**|Defines "what someone can do" in one namespace|"Can read pods in `dev`"|
|**ClusterRole**|Same as Role, but works across all namespaces|"Can delete pods everywhere"|
|**RoleBinding**|Gives a Role to a person in a namespace|"Give read-pods Role to dev-user"|
|**ClusterRoleBinding**|Like RoleBinding but across all namespaces|"Give admin Role to ops-team globally"|

---

### 🪪 **Simple RBAC Example**

You want to **allow dev-user to read pods in `demo` namespace only**.

#### 🔹 Step 1: Create the **Role**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: demo
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

🔍 This says: “Whoever gets this Role can `get` and `list` pods in namespace `demo`.”

#### 🔹 Step 2: Bind the Role to a User

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-read-pods
  namespace: demo
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: read-pods
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

🔍 This means: "Give `read-pods` Role to `dev-user` in the `demo` namespace."

### 👨‍🏫 **Final Summary**

|Thing|Real-World Analogy|
|---|---|
|**Role**|Job description: “Can read rooms A and B”|
|**RoleBinding**|Giving that job to a person|
|**User** or **ServiceAccount**|The employee (or robot) doing the job|
### 🧪 Test It

```bash
kubectl auth can-i list pods --namespace=demo --as=dev-user
```

Let me know if you want examples for:

- writing permissions
- admin role
- service account RBAC

I can help you design the microservice architecture and workflow structure for an affiliate marketing application, though I don't have specific  Code syntax details.

Here's how you could structure a microservice-based affiliate marketing platform:

## Core Microservices Architecture

**User Management Service**

- User registration/authentication
- Affiliate profile management
- Role-based access control

**Product Catalog Service**

- Product information management
- Category and inventory tracking
- Product search and filtering

**Affiliate Link Service**

- Generate unique tracking links
- Link validation and management
- Deep linking support

**Tracking Service**

- Click tracking and attribution
- Conversion tracking
- Real-time event processing

**Commission Service**

- Commission calculation rules
- Payout processing
- Commission tier management

**Analytics Service**

- Performance metrics
- Reporting dashboards
- Data aggregation

**Payment Service**

- Payment processing
- Payout management
- Financial reconciliation

## Workflow Structure for Agent Development

When working with agents, you might structure tasks like:

1. **Service Generation**: Have agents create individual microservices with standard patterns
2. **API Design**: Generate RESTful APIs with consistent schemas
3. **Database Schema**: Create optimized database designs for each service
4. **Integration Logic**: Build service-to-service communication
5. **Testing Suite**: Generate comprehensive test coverage
6. **Deployment Config**: Create containerization and orchestration files

# You can structure an agent flow for building the affiliate marketing microservice app:

## Multi-Agent Workflow Structure

### 1. **Architecture Agent** (Lead/Coordinator)

- Analyzes requirements and creates overall system design
- Defines service boundaries and data contracts
- Creates API specifications and database schemas
- Coordinates other agents and resolves dependencies

### 2. **Service Development Agents** (Parallel Execution)

Each specialized for one microservice:

**User Service Agent**

```
Tasks:
- Create user authentication/authorization
- Build profile management endpoints
- Implement role-based access control
- Generate user data models
```

**Product Catalog Agent**

```
Tasks:
- Build product CRUD operations
- Implement search and filtering
- Create category management
- Set up inventory tracking
```

**Affiliate Link Agent**

```
Tasks:
- Create link generation logic
- Build URL shortening service
- Implement link validation
- Add analytics tracking hooks
```

**Tracking Agent**

```
Tasks:
- Build event ingestion pipeline
- Create real-time tracking system
- Implement attribution logic
- Set up data storage optimization
```

### 3. **Integration Agent**

- Creates service-to-service communication
- Builds API gateway configuration
- Implements message queues/event streaming
- Handles cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring)

### 4. **Testing Agent**

- Generates unit tests for each service
- Creates integration test suites
- Builds end-to-end testing scenarios
- Implements performance testing

### 5. **DevOps Agent**

- Creates Docker configurations
- Builds CI/CD pipelines
- Sets up Kubernetes manifests
- Implements monitoring and alerting

## Agent Coordination Flow

```
1. Architecture Agent → Define system design
   ↓
2. Parallel Service Agents → Build individual services
   ↓
3. Integration Agent → Connect services
   ↓
4. Testing Agent → Validate functionality
   ↓
5. DevOps Agent → Deploy and monitor
```

## Agent Communication Pattern

**Sequential Dependencies:**

- Architecture → Service Agents
- Service Agents → Integration Agent
- Integration → Testing Agent

**Parallel Execution:**

- All Service Development Agents work simultaneously
- Testing Agent can start unit tests while services are being built

**Feedback Loops:**

- Testing Agent reports issues back to Service Agents
- Integration Agent coordinates with Architecture Agent for design changes

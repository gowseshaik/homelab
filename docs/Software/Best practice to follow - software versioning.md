When pushing software to GitHub (or any version control system), it's generally recommended to **avoid using certain version numbers as the base version** to prevent confusion or follow common conventions. Here are some guidelines:

### **Versions to Avoid as Base (Initial) Versions:**
1. **`v0.0.0`**  
   - Too ambiguous; suggests the project is not even in a pre-release state.
   - Often used as a placeholder in dependency systems.

2. **`v1.0.0` (unless the software is truly stable)**  
   - `1.0.0` typically signifies a stable, production-ready release.  
   - If your project is still experimental, starting with `0.x.x` (e.g., `0.1.0`) is better.

3. **Unconventional or Joke Versions (e.g., `v999.0.0`, `v0.0.1-alpha-snapshot`)**  
   - Can cause issues with dependency managers (npm, pip, Maven, etc.).  
   - Makes the project look unprofessional.

4. **`v0.0.1` (Too Minimal)**  
   - While technically valid, it doesn’t convey meaningful progress.  
   - Better to start with `v0.1.0` (first pre-release with basic features).

### **Recommended Starting Versions:**
| Scenario | Recommended Starting Version |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| **Experimental / Early Development** | `v0.1.0` (first testable release) |
| **Stable / Production-ready from Day 1** (rare) | `v1.0.0` |
| **Following Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** | `v0.1.0` → `v1.0.0` when API stabilizes |

### **Best Practices:**
- Use **[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/)** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).  
- For pre-releases, use suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta.1`).  
- Avoid skipping versions (e.g., jumping from `v0.1.0` to `v2.0.0` without reason).

```bash

```
The error means `etcdctl` cannot connect to your etcd server at `127.0.0.1:2379`. The connection is refused because etcd is either not running or not listening on that address/port.

Check these:

```bash
# Check if etcd is running
ps aux | grep etcd

# Or if using systemd
sudo systemctl status etcd

# Check if port 2379 is open
ss -tlnp | grep 2379
```

If etcd is not running, start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start etcd
```

If etcd is running but on a different address/port, set the endpoint explicitly:

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=<your-etcd-ip>:<port> put foo "bar"
```

# For a k3d cluster
For a **k3d cluster**, etcd runs inside the k3s server container and is not directly accessible on `127.0.0.1:2379` by default.

To interact with etcd in k3d/k3s, you usually:

1. **Exec into the k3s server container** where etcd runs.
    
2. Use etcdctl inside that container with the correct environment variables.
    

Example commands:

```bash
# List k3d containers
docker ps | grep k3d

# Exec into the k3s server container (replace container name)
docker exec -it <k3d-server-container-name> sh

# Inside container, set etcdctl env variables and run command
export ETCDCTL_API=3
export ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS=https://127.0.0.1:2379
export ETCDCTL_CACERT=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/etcd/server-ca.crt
export ETCDCTL_CERT=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/etcd/client.crt
export ETCDCTL_KEY=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/etcd/client.key

etcdctl put foo "bar"
```

If you want, I can give you the exact command to get your k3d server container name and run etcdctl inside it.

If you **really need etcdctl**, consider:

- Running an etcdctl container inside k3d with mounted certs.
    
- Or use the k3s builtin ==`3s etcd-snapshot`== commands if your version supports it.

# To ensure **etcd is configured for HA** in **K3s cluster**
verify the following directly on the master nodes:

## ✅ Checklist: Confirm etcd is HA in K3s

### 🔹 1. **Check etcd members**

Run on **any master node**:

```bash
sudo k3s etcd-member-list
```

> ✅ If you see **3 healthy members** (one per master), it's HA

### 🔹 2. **Check etcd data directory**

```bash
ls -l /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db/etcd
```

> ✅ If the directory exists, K3s is using **embedded etcd**

### 🔹 3. **Check logs for etcd cluster formation**

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i etcd | grep member
```

or

```bash
sudo cat /tmp/k3s.log | grep etcd
```

> ✅ Look for lines showing member joining, leader election, etc.

### 🔹 4. **Check K3s process flags**

```bash
ps aux | grep k3s
```

> ✅ You should see `--cluster-init` on the first node, and `--server https://...` on others.

### 🔹 5. **Check Kubernetes node roles**

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

> ✅ You should see **3 control-plane nodes**, not just one.

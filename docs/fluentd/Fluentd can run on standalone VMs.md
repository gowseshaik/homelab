Yes, Fluentd **can run on standalone VMs** (including those running Siebel or any apps) to collect logs and forward them.
### How it works on standalone VMs:

- Install Fluentd agent on the VM.
- Configure Fluentd to **tail application log files** (e.g., Siebel logs).
- Fluentd forwards logs to your desired backend (Elasticsearch, Loki, remote syslog, etc.).

| Setup              | Fluentd Role                 | Use Case                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Kubernetes Cluster | DaemonSet log collector      | Collect container logs      |
| Standalone VM      | Fluentd agent daemon/service | Collect app logs from files |

Fluentd is very flexible and works well outside Kubernetes for log collection and forwarding.
